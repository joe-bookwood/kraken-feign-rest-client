# Rest client for the Kraken Trading Platform
This client is for the use in a Spring Boot based microservice. I did not find a 
[OpenFeign](https://github.com/OpenFeign) based client and decide to write my own.
Rest client communicate with the [Kraken Rest Api](https://www.kraken.com/features/api) of the Kraken trading platform.

I was inspired by this [client](https://github.com/sbouclier/kraken-java-api-client). Thx for this great work.

**In progress ..**
